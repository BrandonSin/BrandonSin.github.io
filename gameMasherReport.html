    <h3>A Hero's Duel Button Masher Game </h3>
    <br>
    <p>This project was made with React frontend. I conducted an interview with a classmate whom he informed of his hobbies and how he spent his days during
        the pandemic. From what I garnered, he is a video game ethusiast. From playing games to reading lores to eventually creating games on Godot. I can safely
        say that my statement about him is correct. My interviewee really enjoys the dark souls series, therefore I wanted to create something
        special for him. From my early sketches, I wanted to create a game that requires a bit of reaction time such as pressing a button within the time limit
        or something that relates to "boss-fighting". To brainstorm my ideas, I went with the 10 + 10 concept art method in determining the best idea.

    <p>From these rough sketches, sketch number 2 was the closet to what I would imagine if the dark souls series was reduced to
        a single button game. The other sketches was missing a crucial aspect of dark souls which is the boss fight itself. From my decision, I yet again
        created another 10 sketches of sketch 2 to further develop the idea.

    <p>In these sketches, there are a variety of different approaches I could do for a clicker game. Sketch 10 and 8 were ones I had in mind
        on creating the game. Since dark souls is a hard game I wanted to make a gauntlet run that can roughly simulate the difficulty of the game. For Sketch 8,
        it is a depiction of a boss battle that requires the player to go offensively and defensively. Of course since the game is a singular button, the player's 
        aggression would be completely dictated by the game's pace. However, in every project one of the most important aspect is if the product is achievable or not.
        Unfortunately, it is my first time working with React and with limited time, I decided to go with sketch 5. Which is a simple attack button performed to defeat a singular enemy
        before the time runs out. Down below is a video demonstration of what the game looks like in every state.
