    <h3>A Hero's Duel Button Masher Game </h3>
    <br>
    <p>This project was made with React frontend. I conducted an interview with a classmate whom he informed of his hobbies and how he spent his days during
        the pandemic. From what I garnered, he is a video game ethusiast. From playing games to reading lores to eventually creating games on Godot. I can safely
        say that my statement about him is correct. My interviewee really enjoys the dark souls series, therefore I wanted to create something
        special for him. <br/><br/>To summarize what dark souls is. It is a game that does not hold the hands of a player. The player must learn
        and adapt to the mechanics of the game through trial-and-error in order to succeed.Therefore, I wanted to create something that gives off the vibe of dark souls.
        To brainstorm my ideas, I went with the 10 + 10 method in determining the best idea. From my early sketches, I wanted to create a game that requires a bit of reaction time such as pressing a button within the time limit
        or something that relates to "boss-fighting". A lot of sketches depict some type of on-rail gameplay with a button to react with the environment.

    <p>From these rough sketches, sketch number 2 was the closet to what I would imagine if the dark souls series was reduced to
        a single button game. The other sketches was missing a crucial aspect of dark souls which is the boss fight itself. From my decision, I yet again
        created another 10 sketches of sketch 2 to further develop the idea.

    <p>In these sketches, there are a variety of different approaches I could do for a clicker game. Sketch 2 is an interesting choice, as it takes player to a 
        first person perspective, however, the animation would need to be precise in order to have a seamless experience. As a result, Sketch 10 and 8 were the ones I had in mind
        on creating the game. Since dark souls is a hard game I wanted to make a gauntlet run that can roughly simulate the difficulty of the game. For Sketch 8,
        it is a depiction of a boss battle that requires the player to go offensively and defensively. Of course since the game is a singular button, the player's 
        aggression would be completely dictated by the game's pace. However, in every project one of the most important aspect is if the product is achievable or not.
        Unfortunately, it is my first time working with React and with limited time. I decided to go with a fusion of sketch 1 and sketch 5. A simple button masher that has a timer
        for additive difficulty and a health bar like any other rpgs.

        <h3>Artistic Choices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The pulsing red button conveys the notion of urgency. Which is what I want the player to have when
                trying to mash the button before the timer runs out
            </li>
            <li>The timer like the pulsing red button gives out the sense of urgency and adding some difficulty to the game to better
                emulate how dark souls feel.
            </li>
            <li>The Dark background compliments the red pulsing button by making it stand out
            </li>
            <li>The Adventurer sprite is just like how every other player is in the game, an Adventurer who is exploring an unknown world
            </li>
            <li>I chose this worm monster because of its features. It has similar artistic style as the adventurer and it's on the level of grotesque like dark souls
            </li>
            <li>The Health bar is a common feature of any rpg games and it's good feedback for the player's progress
            </li>
        </ul>
