      <div class ="col-12">
        <p>I am a student of the University of Calgary majoring in Computer Science. As a visual learner, I find myself interested in HCI related fields. I believe mixed reality is the future
          technology that will bring human cognition to a new level. I find dedication, honesty and resiliency to be key qualities in having a successful life. 
          My ability to cope with challenges and successes rendered me mentally stronger - now I wish to open up a new chapter and face new challenges.<br /><br />
          Outside of school I currently have a part time job at Kumon. There I learn valuable assets such as communication, patience and group dynamics. On my free time I enjoy playing the violin, video games, board games, sports, watching Tv Shows and especially conversing about video games.

      <h3>Front End Design for VR Viewing Platform </h3>
      <br>
      <p>This was a project in my human computer interaction class. I worked with four other people including myself
        in trying to create a visual representation of how a VR viewing platform would look like. The goal of this project was to provide an interactive
        way for users to experience live events/recorded without having to be physically present. In doing so, we hope that this would be an incentive
        for musicians and artists to sell/promote their VR content using our application.

      <h3>Connect Four</h3>
      <br>
      <p>This was an individual project during my web application class. In this project I utilized socket.io to help create multiple
        game rooms and acknowledgments. On backend side I used express node.js and on the client side I used embedded js as the game
        was mainly done in javascript.Down below there are screenshots of the main menu and the in-game. The player has the ability
        to create a game, join a random game or enter a game using a passcode. An active player list is presented on the right of the main screen.
        All of these are done by the sockets communicating between the client and the server.

      <h3>Crime Rate in Calgary</h3>
      <p>In this three person project (Jason Dam, Garland Khuu, Brandon Sin), we wanted to find a prevalent issue and visualize it.
        We came across a dataset found on Alberta Public Statistics that was composed of Crime statistics in Calgary during the years of
        2012-2019. Our goal was to create a visualization that provides information corresponding to the user's interaction and using 
        the LRT station as a landmark. Using the dataset, we extracted important data to create sketchable ideas for our final visualization. 
        At the end, we decided to use a 2D map layout of Calgary and allow users to toggle between years, different layouts and clickable districts.
        Using the D3 library, we were able to create an interactive, aesthetically pleasing visual for any users to enjoy.

      <h3>Blender Logo Model</h3>
      <p>In this mini project I helped my client (https://www.twitch.tv/zlyphor/) create a 3-D model of his logo. I created this model using the Blender software. As a beginner, I am happy with
        the result even though some of the edges are not convincing. The model consisted of basic extrusions, alternating materials, and lighting angles.

      <h3>Button Masher Game</h3>
      <p>In this mini project, I took the hobbies that my classmate indulged in during the isolation and turned it into a Game.
        I created a clicker game using the React framework with React bootstrap. From this project I learned to work with useStates acknowledgments
        useEffects and Components. Furthermore about the project can be viewed by clicking the "review button" and feel free to try out the game.
